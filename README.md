# Programming-Language-Training
In this repository I am trying to explore and get to know as many programming languages (and possibly also frameworks) as possible. In order to do that I try to implement the same simple scenario in each language.

I use the same scenario because that way, hopefully, I will be able to compare different aspects of the languages better. Also for the sake of comparison I'll also implement the scenario in programming languages that I know quite well such as Java, C#, C++ etc.

## Scenario: Song Management
- The program should be able to add songs to a song collection (or playlist if you will)
- The songs are represented as a string such as: "ID=1, bad guy by Billie Eilish, Length: 192 seconds"
- The songs must at least contain an ID, a title and the name of the artist
- It must be possibile to save all the songs in form of a text file on the local machine
- It must also be possible to load that text file so that it is possible to see all the saved songs at once

And that's it. Quite simple but maybe good enough to learn a thing or two about a programming language.

### Possible additions:
- Not only songs, but different types of media (books, movies, pictures or whatever)
- Being able to modify the saved songs
- Creating a GUI
- Using a proper DB instead of a text file

I think there are plenty of more.
